Question 2: Explain the purpose of componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(),
and componentWillUnmount().

1. componentDidMount()
=> When it is called:
    -> Invoked once, immediately after the component is mounted (inserted into the DOM).
=> Purpose:
    -> Used to perform any setup required for the component, such as:
        -> Fetching data from an API.
        -> Setting up event listeners.
        -> Initializing third-party libraries.

2. componentDidUpdate()
=> When it is called:
    -> Invoked immediately after the component updates, i.e., after the render() method is re-executed due to changes in props or state.
=> Purpose:
    -> Used to perform actions in response to changes, such as:
        -> Fetching new data when a prop changes.
        -> Updating the DOM based on updated state.
        -> Logging or debugging component updates.

3. componentWillUnmount()
=> When it is called:
    -> Invoked immediately before the component is unmounted (removed from the DOM).
=> Purpose:
    -> Used to clean up resources such as:
        -> Removing event listeners.
        -> Cancelling API requests.
        -> Clearing timers or intervals.
        -> Releasing resources like subscriptions.
