Question 2: Explain the core principles of React such as the virtual DOM and componentbased architecture.

=> 1. Virtual DOM:
    -> The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It acts as a "middle layer" between the real DOM and React's rendering process.

    -> React creates a virtual representation of the UI.
    
    -> When the state or props change, React updates the Virtual DOM instead of directly updating the real DOM.
    
    -> React compares the updated Virtual DOM with the previous version using a process called reconciliation.
    
    -> It calculates the minimal set of changes (called a "diff") and applies them to the real DOM.

=> 2. Component-Based Architecture:
    ->  Components are independent, reusable pieces of UI that encapsulate their own logic, structure, and behavior. They can be thought of as building blocks for React applications.

    -> Class Components: Older approach, uses ES6 classes and lifecycle methods.

    -> Function Components: Modern approach, utilizes React hooks for state and lifecycle management.

    -> Components can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing duplication.

    -> Smaller, isolated components are easier to debug and update.

    -> Components can be nested, allowing developers to build complex UIs from simple parts.
