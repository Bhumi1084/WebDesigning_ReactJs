Question 1: What do you mean by RESTful web services?

=> RESTful web services are APIs that adhere to the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), an architectural style for designing networked applications

=> Stateless: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to process it, with no session state stored on the server

=> Resource-Oriented: Resources are identified by URLs (e.g., /users/123 for user 123).

=> HTTP Methods: Uses standard HTTP methods for operations:
    -> GET: Retrieve data.
    -> POST: Create new resources.
    -> PUT/PATCH: Update existing resources.
    -> DELETE: Remove resources.

=> Data Formats: Commonly uses JSON or XML for request and response bodies.

=> Uniform Interface: Ensures a consistent way of interacting with resources.
