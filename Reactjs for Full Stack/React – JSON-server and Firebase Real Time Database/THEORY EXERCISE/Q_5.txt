Question 5: Discuss the importance of handling errors and loading states when working
withAPIs in React

=> Importance of Handling Errors
-> User Feedback: Informing users when something goes wrong (e.g., failed API call) enhances transparency and trust.

-> Debugging: Proper error handling helps developers identify and fix issues during development and in production.

-> Prevent Crashes: Unhandled errors can break the application, leading to poor user experience.

-> Fallback Mechanisms: Allows the app to display alternative content or retry failed requests.

=> Importance of Handling Loading States:
-> User Experience: Showing a loading indicator prevents users from feeling the app is unresponsive.

-> Performance Perception: A visible loading state manages user expectations, even during slow network responses.

-> Avoid Premature Rendering: Ensures the UI is updated only after the data is fetched successfully.

-> Better Navigation: Helps users understand when an operation, like form submission or page transition, is in progress.
