Question 3: What is the role of render() in class components?

=> The render() method is a key function in React class components. 

=> It is responsible for describing what should be displayed on the screen by returning JSX. 

=> It works similarly to the function body of a functional component.

=> The render() method is a part of Reactâ€™s rendering lifecycle:

    -> 1. Initial Render: Called once when the component is mounted for the first time.
    -> 2. Subsequent Renders: Called again whenever state or props change.
    -> 3. Controlled Updates: Developers can control re-rendering by implementing shouldComponentUpdate().
