Question 2: How do you pass data to a component using props?

=> Props are passed to a child component as attributes in the parent component's JSX.

=> The child component receives the props as a single object (props).

=> Props are accessed in the child component using dot notation (props.propertyName) or destructuring.

=> Props are read-only in the child component. This means a child cannot modify props directly.

=> If you need to modify data, use state or pass callback functions to handle updates in the parent component.

=> Props are a fundamental concept in React for passing data to child components, enabling the creation of dynamic, reusable, and modular UIs. 

=> By combining props with JavaScript expressions, developers can build powerful and interactive components.
