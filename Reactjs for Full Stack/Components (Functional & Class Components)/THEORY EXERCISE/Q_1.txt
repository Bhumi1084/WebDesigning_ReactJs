Question 1: What are components in React? Explain the difference between functional
components and class components.

=> Components are the building blocks of a React application. 

=> They allow developers to break the user interface (UI) into reusable, self-contained pieces, each responsible for rendering a specific part of the UI.

=> Components make it easier to build and manage complex UIs by separating concerns and enabling reusability.

=> Functional Components: Plain JavaScript functions.
=> 	Class Components: ES6 classes extending React.Component.

=> Functional Components: Use hooks like useEffect.
=> 	Class Components: Have lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.

=> Functional Components: Simpler and easier to read.
=> 	Class Components: More verbose and complex.

=> Functional Components: Typically faster due to simpler structure.
=> 	Class Components: Slightly slower due to this bindings.

=> Functional Components: Preferred for most cases due to hooks.
=> 	Class Components: Used less frequently; primarily in legacy code.
