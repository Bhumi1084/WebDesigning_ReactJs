Question 3: Discuss the importance of using curly braces {} in JSX expressions.

=> Curly braces {} in JSX play a crucial role in embedding JavaScript expressions within JSX code. 

=> They act as placeholders that allow developers to integrate dynamic content, execute logic, or invoke functions within the UI structure.

=> Flexibility: Makes UI creation dynamic and interactive by combining static layout with dynamic data.

=> Efficiency: Reduces the need for manual DOM manipulations by integrating logic directly into the structure.

=> Readability: Keeps logic and UI together, enhancing code clarity.

=> Curly braces {} in JSX are indispensable for embedding JavaScript expressions, making React components powerful and dynamic. 

=> They bridge the gap between logic and UI, enabling seamless integration of data and interactivity.
