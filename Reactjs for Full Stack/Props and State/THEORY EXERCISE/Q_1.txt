Question 1: What are props in React.js? How are props different from state?

=> In React, props (short for properties) are a mechanism to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are:

-> Immutable: They cannot be modified by the child component.

-> Read-Only: Designed to enable data flow in one direction (from parent to child).

-> Passed as attributes in JSX and accessed in the child component using this.props (in class components) or directly via parameters (in functional components).

=> Props: Input data passed to components
=> State: Data managed within the component

=> Props: Immutable
=> State: Mutable

=> Props: props passed from parent
=> State: state is local to the component

=> Props: Parent controls data flow
=> State: Component manages its own state
