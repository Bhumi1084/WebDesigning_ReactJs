Question 3: Why is this.setState() used in class components, and how does it work?

=> In React class components, this.setState() is used to update the state of the component. It:

-> Modifies the Component's State: Allows developers to update the state object dynamically.

-> Triggers a Re-render: Informs React that the state has changed, prompting the component and its child components to re-render with the updated data.

-> Merges State: Updates only the specified properties in the state, leaving others unchanged.

=> How this.setState() Works

=> 1. Asynchronous Updates:
-> this.setState() does not immediately update the state; instead, it schedules the state update to be processed by React.
-> This ensures optimal performance by batching multiple state updates.

=> 2. Partial Updates:
-> Only the properties specified in the setState call are updated. Other properties in the state remain unchanged.

=> 3. Re-rendering:
-> Once the state is updated, React compares the new state with the previous state and efficiently updates the DOM with the changes.
