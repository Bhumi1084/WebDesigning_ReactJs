Question 2: Explain the difference between BrowserRouter, Route, Link, and Switch
components in React Router.

1. BrowserRouter:

    -> The top-level component that provides the routing context to the application.

    -> Uses the browser's History API to handle URLs.

2. Route:

    -> Defines the mapping between a URL path and the component to render.

    -> Example: <Route path="/about" component={About} />.

3. Link:

    -> Used for navigation between routes without refreshing the page.

    -> Example: <Link to="/about">Go to About</Link>.

4. Switch:

    -> Renders the first child <Route> that matches the URL.

    -> Useful for ensuring only one route is rendered at a time.

=> BrowserRouter is the wrapper for routing.

=> Route defines paths.

=> Link provides navigation.

=> Switch ensures exclusive rendering of a route.
