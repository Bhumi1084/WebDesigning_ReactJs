Question 3: What is useReducer ? How we use in react app?

=> useReducer is a React hook that lets you manage complex state in functional components.

=> It works by taking a reducer function and an initial state, and it returns the current state and a dispatch function.

=> The reducer function specifies how the state should be updated in response to actions.

=> How it works:

1. Reducer Function:
    -> This function takes the current state and an action as arguments, and it returns the new state.   
        The action is an object that describes how the state should be changed.   
    ->It is common to use a switch statement inside of the reducer function, to handle different action     types.   

2. Initial State:
    -> This is the initial value of the state.

3. Dispatch Function:
    -> This function is used to trigger state updates by dispatching actions to the reducer.   
    
    -> When you call dispatch with an action, React calls the reducer function with the current state and the action, and then updates the state with the reducer's return value.
