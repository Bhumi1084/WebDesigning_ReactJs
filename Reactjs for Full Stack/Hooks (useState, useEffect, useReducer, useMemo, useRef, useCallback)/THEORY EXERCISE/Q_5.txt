Question 5: Whatâ€™s the Difference between the useCallback & useMemo Hooks?

=> useCallback: This hook memoizes a function itself.
=> useMemo: This hook memoizes a calculated value

=> useCallback: It also takes a function and a dependency array as arguments.
=> useMemo: It takes a function and a dependency array as arguments.

=> useCallback: It returns the memoized function.
=> useMemo: It executes the function and returns the result.

=> useCallback: It only creates a new function reference if the dependencies change.
=> useMemo: It only re-executes the function and recalculates the value if the dependencies change.
