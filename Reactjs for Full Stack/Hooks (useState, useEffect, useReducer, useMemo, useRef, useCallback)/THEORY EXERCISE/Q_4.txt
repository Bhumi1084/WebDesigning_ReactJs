Question 4: What is the purpose of useCallback & useMemo Hooks?

=> useMemo is used to memoize the result of a computation. It caches the computed value and only recalculates it when its dependencies change.
   
=> This is particularly useful for expensive calculations that would otherwise be performed on every render, potentially slowing down the application.

=> useCallback is used to memoize functions. It caches the function itself, preventing it from being recreated on every render.   

=> This is especially important when passing callbacks as props to child components, as it can prevent unnecessary re-renders of those child components.
