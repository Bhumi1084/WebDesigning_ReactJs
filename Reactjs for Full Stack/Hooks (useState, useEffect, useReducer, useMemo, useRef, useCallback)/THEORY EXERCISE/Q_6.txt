Question 6 : What is useRef ? How to work in react app?

=> The useRef hook in React is a powerful tool that allows you to create mutable references that persist across renders.

=> How it works in a React app:

1. Creating a ref:
    -> You create a ref using the useRef hook and assign it an initial value (which can be null).
    -> const myRef = useRef(initialValue);

2. Accessing the current value:
    -> The ref object has a current property that holds the current value. You can access and modify this value directly.
    -> myRef.current

3. Attaching a ref to a DOM element:
    -> To attach a ref to a DOM element, you pass the ref object to the element's ref attribute.
    -> <input ref={myRef} />
    -> React will then set the current property of the ref object to the DOM element.

4. Mutating the value::
    -> Unlike state variables, changing the current property of a ref does not trigger a re-render.
