Question 1: What is the Context API in React? How is it used to manage global state across
multiple components?

=> The Context API in React is a built-in feature that allows for state management across multiple components without the need for prop drilling. 

=> It provides a way to share values (like global state) between components without having to pass props manually at every level.

=> How Context API Works:
=> Context API consists of three main parts:
    -> React.createContext() – Creates a context object.
    -> Provider – Wraps components and provides a global state.
    -> Consumer (or useContext Hook) – Allows components to access the context values.
