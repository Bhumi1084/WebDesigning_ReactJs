Question 2: Explain how createContext() and useContext() are used in React for
sharing state.

1. createContext()
=> createContext() is used to create a Context object that holds shared state or values.
=> It returns a Provider and a Consumer:
    -> Provider: Supplies the state to consuming components.
    -> Consumer (or useContext Hook): Retrieves the shared state in child components.

2. useContext()
=> useContext() is a React Hook that allows components to access the nearest Providerâ€™s value directly.
=> It eliminates the need for the Consumer component, making the code cleaner and more readable.
=> useContext() re-renders the component whenever the context value changes.
