Question 1: What is conditional rendering in React? How can you conditionally render
elements in a React component?

=> Conditional rendering in React refers to dynamically deciding which elements or components should be displayed based on a certain condition. 

=> It is similar to how conditions are handled in regular JavaScript (e.g., if statements), but it is used to control the output of React components.

=> Conditional rendering in React allows you to build dynamic, responsive interfaces by rendering different elements or components based on the application's state or props. 

=> By leveraging techniques such as if-else, ternary operators, or logical operators, you can implement conditional rendering effectively.
