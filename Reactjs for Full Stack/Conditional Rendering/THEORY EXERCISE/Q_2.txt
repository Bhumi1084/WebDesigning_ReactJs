Question 2: Explain how if-else, ternary operators, and && (logical AND) are used in JSX
for conditional rendering.

=> In JSX, conditional rendering is a way to decide what to display in the UI based on a condition. 

=> Below is a detailed explanation of how if-else, ternary operators, and the logical && operator are used for conditional rendering in React.

=> Use if-else for more complex branching logic.

=> Use the ternary operator for concise and readable true/false conditions.

=> Use && for conditions where only the true case needs rendering. 

=> By choosing the appropriate method, you can write cleaner and more maintainable conditional rendering logic in JSX.
