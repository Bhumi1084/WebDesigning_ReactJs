Question 1: How do you render a list of items in React? Why is it important to use keys
when rendering lists?

=> Keys are important for React's reconciliation process.

=> React uses keys to identify which elements in the list have changed, been added, or removed. 

=> This optimization allows React to efficiently update the DOM and maintain performance.

=> Benefits of Using Keys:

1. Improved Performance:
    => Helps React minimize re-renders by identifying unchanged elements.
2. Accurate Updates:
    => Ensures React matches the correct virtual DOM element with its counterpart in the real DOM.
3. Prevents Rendering Bugs:
    => Without unique keys, React may incorrectly reuse elements or mismanage updates.
