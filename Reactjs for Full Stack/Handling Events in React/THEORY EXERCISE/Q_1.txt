Question 1: How are events handled in React compared to vanilla JavaScript? Explain the
concept of synthetic events

=> Aspect : Attachment
=> Vanilla JS Events : Added directly to DOM elements
=> React Synthetic Events : Managed via JSX attributes in components

=> Aspect : Cross-Browser Support
=> Vanilla JS Events : Requires polyfills for compatibility
=> React Synthetic Events : Handled natively by React's abstraction

=> Aspect : Event Pooling
=> Vanilla JS Events : Not applicable
=> React Synthetic Events : Events are pooled for efficiency
 
=> Aspect : Event Handler Context
=> Vanilla JS Events : this may need binding
=> React Synthetic Events : Automatically bound in modern React (hooks/components)
